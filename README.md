## My Journey

Building ACONEWS has been an incredible journey. Here’s a brief overview of my experience:

- **Initial Setup**:  I started by setting up the frontend with React and Tailwind CSS and connecting it to the backend built with Node.js and Express. Ensuring that the frontend and backend communicated seamlessly was a crucial first step.
- **Development**: Focused on building a responsive UI with React and Tailwind CSS. Integrated the GNews API to fetch and display news articles.
- **Challenges**: The most challenging part of the project was implementing the pagination and search functionality efficiently. Balancing API requests to avoid rate limits while keeping the application responsive required some creative problem-solving. I also spent considerable time ensuring that the news feed and slider components were optimized for different screen sizes, enhancing the user experience.
- **Learning**: Gained hands-on experience in deploying a full-stack application, working with APIs, and creating responsive designs.
- **Future Improvements**: Plan to enhance the app with additional features and optimizations based on user feedback and emerging technologies. I’m planning to add user authentication, bookmark features, and a personalized news feed. Additionally, I aim to optimize the application further based on user feedback.
